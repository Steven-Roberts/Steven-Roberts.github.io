    <p>
        Since middle school, I have a love for programming and math.  I
        first started programming on a TI-87 graphing calculator where I created
        games like pong and one that would render fractals.  These days, my
        programming language of choice has changed, but not my desire to pursue
        a career in the area of compute science and math has not.
    </p>

    <p>
        One area in which I am most specialized is web development.  In
        my four summers of interning at IIHS, I was able to quickly learn a
        broad range of languages, tools, and frameworks for creating websites.
        I worked effectively in both team and individual settings, and gained
        a wealth of practical, real-world job experience.
    </p>

        Scientific computing is the second area in which I specialize, in
        particular, methods for numerically solving differential equations.
        These sort of problems are of huge importance in understanding complex
        phenomena in physics, chemistry, meteorology, and many other
        disciplines.  As an undergraduate researcher I was able to pick up new,
        cutting-edge numerical methods and abstracts concepts in order to
        implement them.

    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>
        I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and a Bachelor of
        Science degree in Mathematics, both from Virginia Tech.  My
        undergraduate GPA was 3.99.  I am currently working on earning my
        master's degree in Computer Science also at Virginia Tech.
    </p>

    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>
        Outside of work and school I enjoy mountain biking and solving puzzles
        such as Rubik's cubes.  I also stay active by going to the gym, and I
        have recently picked up road biking.
