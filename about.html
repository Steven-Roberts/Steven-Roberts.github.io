    <p>
        Since middle school, I have had a love for programming and math.  I
        first started programming on a TI-87 graphing calculator where I created
        games like pong and a program that would render fractals.  These days,
        my programming language of choice has changed, but not my desire to
        pursue a career in the area of computer science and math has not.
    </p>

    <p>
        One area in which I am most specialized is web development.  In
        my four summers of interning at IIHS, I was able to quickly learn a
        broad range of languages, tools, and frameworks for creating websites.
        I worked effectively in both team and individual settings and gained a
        wealth of practical, real-world job experience.

        Scientific computing is the second area in which I specialize, in
        particular, methods for numerically solving differential equations.
        These sorts of problems are of huge importance in understanding complex
        phenomena in physics, chemistry, meteorology, and many other
        disciplines.  As an undergraduate I focused many of my class on this
        area and started doing research with the
        <a href="http://csl.cs.vt.edu/">Computer Science Laboratory</a> at
        Virginia Tech.  I had the opportunity to apply this knowledge during my
        latest internship, which was with NASA.

    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>
        I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and a Bachelor of
        Science degree in Mathematics, both from Virginia Tech.  My
        undergraduate GPA was 3.99.  I am currently working on earning my
        Ph.D. in Computer Science also at Virginia Tech.
    </p>

    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>
        Outside of work and school, I enjoy mountain biking and solving puzzles.
        I also stay active by going to the gym, and I have recently picked up
        road biking.
