<p>
    Since middle school, I have had a love for programming and math.  I
    first started programming on a TI-87 graphing calculator where I created
    games like pong and a program that would render fractals.  These days,
    my programming language of choice has changed, but not my desire to
    pursue a career in the area of computer science and math has not.

<p>
    Scientific computing is the primary area in which I specialize, in
    particular, methods for numerically solving differential equations.
    These sorts of problems are of huge importance in understanding complex
    phenomena in physics, chemistry, meteorology, and many other
    disciplines.  As an undergraduate I focused many of my class on this
    area and started doing research with the
    <a href="http://csl.cs.vt.edu/">Computer Science Laboratory</a> at
    Virginia Tech.

<p>
    Web development is a hobby of mine.  In my four summers of interning at
    IIHS, I was able to learn a broad range of languages, tools, and frameworks
    for creating websites.  I continue to develop websites, Node.js packages,
    and Chrome extensions in my free time.

<h3>Education</h3>
<p>
    I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and a Bachelor of
    Science degree in Mathematics, both from Virginia Tech.  My
    undergraduate GPA was 3.98.  I am currently working on earning my
    Ph.D. in Computer Science also at Virginia Tech.

<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p>
    Outside of work and school, I enjoy mountain biking and solving puzzles.
    I also stay active by going to the gym, and I have recently picked up
    road biking.
