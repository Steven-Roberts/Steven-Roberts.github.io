Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at Virginia Tech studying Computer Science.  I am a member of the [Computational Science Laboratory](http://csl.cs.vt.edu/), which is led by [Dr. Adrian Sandu](http://people.cs.vt.edu/asandu/).  My research interests include:


<ul class="browser-default">
  <li>Ordinary differential equations and differential algebraic equations</li>
  <li>Multirate methods</li>
  <li>Implicit-explicit methods</li>
  <li>General linear methods</li>
  <li>High-performance computing</li>
  <li>Stiff systems and order reduction</li>
  <li>Machine learning, model order reduction, and surrogate modeling</li>
</ul>

You can find my publications on [Google Scholar]({{ site.links["Google Scholar"] }}).
